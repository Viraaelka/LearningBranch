    Positive integers have so many gorgeous features.
    Some of them could be expressed as a sum of two or more consecutive positive numbers.

    consecutiveDucks(9)  ==>  return (true)  //  9 , could be expressed as a sum of ( 2 + 3 + 4 ) or ( 4 + 5 )
    consecutiveDucks(42)  ==>  return (true) //  42 , could be expressed as a sum of ( 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 )
